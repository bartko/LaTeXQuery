paragpraph, subparagraph</sectionsorder>

<!-- 
List of sections which order corresponds to the tree structure of the document.
In real LaTeX documents 'subsection' is a child of 'section' and structure: 

\section{Section title}
\subsection{Subsection title}

is converted to

<command name="section">  <param>Section title</param>
  <command name="subsection"> <param>Subection title</param>

<parsedenvironments>
document, abstract, figure, table, itemize, enumerate, table,
frame, quote, quotation, verse, thebibliography</parsedenvironments>

<!-- 
List of environments which content will be processed further.  For
example if 'figure' is in the list then the environment

   \begin{figure}
     \includegraphics{fig}
     \caption{text}
   \end{figure}

will be converted to

   <environment name="figure">
     <command name="includegraphics"><param>fig</param></command>
     <command name="caption"><param>text</param></command>
   </environment>

otherwise the content of figure environmet is untouched:

   <environment name="figure">
     \includegraphics{fig}
     \caption{text}
   </environment>

Generally the environments like verbatim, equation, tabular, tabbing,
pstricks, etc.  should not be processed because of useless output and
possible errors.

<environmentswithpar>
document,abstract,quotation
</environmentswithpar>

<!-- 
Here you can add environmets which content you expect to be divided
into paragraphs by <p> tags.  For example when 'abstract' is in the
list then text of abstract environment will be enclosed in <p>'s.

<environment name="abstract">
  <p>First paragraph.</p>

  <p>Second paragraph.</p>
</environment>

Please note it works only for those environments that are set as
parsed in the previous section.

</commandswithpar>

<!-- 
Like above but for LaTeX commands, for example 

<command name="item">
  <p>First paragraph.</p>

  <p>Second paragraph.</p>
</command>

<!-- ********************************************** -->


<environmentsnotinpar>
document,abstract,frame,thebibliography
</environmentsnotinpar>

<!--
Environments that are not expected to be surrounded by paragpraphs.
For example there is no need to place abstract environment into <p>
tag, opposite to its content.
