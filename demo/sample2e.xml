<p>This is an example input file.  Comparing it with
the output it generates can show you how to
produce a simple document of your own.</p>

<command name="section"><param>Ordinary Text</param>  
<!-- Produces section heading.  Lower-level-->
                             <!-- sections are begun with similar -->
                             <!-- \subsection and \subsubsection commands.-->

<p>The ends  of words and sentences are marked 
  by   spaces. It  doesn't matter how many 
spaces    you type; one is as good as 100.  The
end of   a line counts as a space.</p>

<p>One   or more   blank lines denote the  end 
of  a paragraph.</p>  

<p>Since any number of consecutive spaces are treated
like a single one, the formatting of the input
file makes no difference to
      <command name="LaTeX"/>,                <!-- The \LaTeX command generates the LaTeX logo.-->
but it makes a difference to you.  When you use
<command name="LaTeX"/>, making your input file as easy to read 
as possible will be a great help as you write 
your document and when you change it.  This sample 
file shows how you can add comments to your own input 
file.</p>

<p>Because printing is different from typewriting,
there are a number of things that you have to do
differently when preparing an input file than if
you were just typing the document directly.
Quotation marks like
       ``this'' 
have to be handled specially, as do quotes within
quotes:
       ``<command name=","/>`this'            <!-- \, separates the double and single quote.-->
        is what I just 
        wrote, not  `that'<command name=","/>''.</p>  

<p>Dashes come in three sizes: an 
       intra-word 
dash, a medium dash for number ranges like 
       1--2, 
and a punctuation 
       dash---like 
this.</p>

<p>A sentence-ending space should be larger than the
space between words within a sentence.  You
sometimes have to type special commands in
conjunction with punctuation characters to get
this right, as in the following sentence.
       Gnats, gnus, etc.<command name=" "/>all  <!-- `\ ' makes an inter-word space.-->
       begin with G\@.         <!-- \@ marks end-of-sentence punctuation.-->
You should check the spaces after periods when
reading your output to make sure you haven't
forgotten any special cases.  Generating an
ellipsis
       <command name="ldots"/><command name=" "/>              <!-- `\ ' is needed after `\ldots' because TeX -->
                             <!-- ignores spaces after command names like \ldots -->
                             <!-- made from \ + letters.-->
                             <!---->
                             <!-- Note how a `%' character causes TeX to ignore -->
                             <!-- the end of the input line, so these blank lines -->
                             <!-- do not start a new paragraph.-->
                             <!---->
with the right spacing around the periods requires
a special command.</p>

<p><command name="LaTeX"/><command name=" "/>interprets some common characters as
commands, so you must type special commands to
generate them.  These characters include the
following:
       <command name="$"/> <command name="&amp;"/> <command name="%"/> <command name="#"/> <command name="{"/> and <command name="}"/>.</p>

<p>In printing, text is usually emphasized with an
       <command name="emph"><param>italic</param></command>  
type style.</p>  

<p><environment name="em">
   A long segment of text can also be emphasized 
   in this way.  Text within such a segment can be 
   given \emph{additional} emphasis.
</environment></p>

<p>It is sometimes necessary to prevent <command name="LaTeX"/><command name=" "/>from
breaking a line where it might otherwise do so.
This may be at a space, as between the ``Mr.''<command name=" "/>and
``Jones'' in
       ``Mr.~Jones'',        <!-- ~ produces an unbreakable interword space.-->
or within a word---especially when the word is a
symbol like
       <command name="mbox"><param><command name="emph"><param>itemnum</param></command></param></command> 
that makes little sense when hyphenated across
lines.</p>

<p>Footnotes<command name="footnote"><param>This is an example of a footnote.</param></command>
pose no problem.</p>

<p><command name="LaTeX"/><command name=" "/>is good at typesetting mathematical formulas
like
       <mathmode type="parentheses"> x-3y + z = 7 </mathmode> 
or
       <mathmode type="parentheses"> a_{1} &gt; x^{2n} + y^{2n} &gt; x' </mathmode>
or  
       <mathmode type="parentheses"> \ip{A}{B} = \sum_{i} a_{i} b_{i} </mathmode>.
The spaces you type in a formula are 
ignored.  Remember that a letter like
       <mathmode type="dollar">x</mathmode>                   <!-- $ ... $  and  \( ... \)  are equivalent-->
is a formula when it denotes a mathematical
symbol, and it should be typed as one.</p></command>

<command name="section"><param>Displayed Text</param>

<p>Text is displayed by indenting it from the left
margin.  Quotations are commonly displayed.  There
are short quotations
<environment name="quote">
   This is a short quotation.  It consists of a 
   single paragraph of text.  See how it is formatted.
</environment>
and longer ones.
<environment name="quotation">
   <p>This is a longer quotation.  It consists of two
   paragraphs of text, neither of which are
   particularly interesting.</p>

   <p>This is the second paragraph of the quotation.  It
   is just as dull as the first paragraph.</p>
</environment>
Another frequently-displayed structure is a list.
The following is an example of an <command name="emph"><param>itemized</param></command>
list.
<environment name="itemize">
   <command name="item"> <p>This is the first item of an itemized list.
         Each item in the list is marked with a ``tick''.
         You don't have to worry about what kind of tick
         mark is used.</p></command>

   <command name="item"> <p>This is the second item of the list.  It
         contains another list nested inside it.  The inner
         list is an <command name="emph"><param>enumerated</param></command> list.
         <environment name="enumerate">
            <command name="item"> <p>This is the first item of an enumerated 
                  list that is nested within the itemized list.</p></command>

            <command name="item"> <p>This is the second item of the inner list.  
                  <command name="LaTeX"/><command name=" "/>allows you to nest lists deeper than 
                  you really should.</p></command>
         </environment>
         This is the rest of the second item of the outer
         list.  It is no more interesting than any other
         part of the item.</p></command>
   <command name="item"> <p>This is the third item of the list.</p></command>
</environment>
You can even display poetry.
<environment name="verse">
   There is an environment 
    for verse <command name="\"/>             <!-- The \\ command separates lines-->
   Whose features some poets <!-- within a stanza.-->
   will curse.   

                             <!-- One or more blank lines separate stanzas.-->

   For instead of making<command name="\"/>
   Them do <command name="emph"><param>all</param></command> line breaking, <command name="\"/>
   It allows them to put too many words on a line when they'd rather be 
   forced to be terse.
</environment></p>

<p>Mathematical formulas may also be displayed.  A
displayed formula 
is 
one-line long; multiline
formulas require special formatting instructions.
   <mathmode type="brackets">  \ip{\Gamma}{\psi'} = x'' + y^{2} + z_{i}^{n}</mathmode>
Don't start a paragraph with a displayed equation,
nor make one a paragraph by itself.</p></command>
